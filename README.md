# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using the Pygame library. The game features a player versus computer mode, where the player is 'X' and the computer is 'O'.

# Features

    Play against the computer with an intelligent move generator.
    The game window is designed with a grid layout and allows players to make moves by clicking on the desired cell.
    The winner is determined based on the traditional rules of Tic Tac Toe.
    Press 'RSHIFT' to restart the game.

# Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Pygame library (pip install pygame)

# How to Play

    Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed.
    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Run the tic_tac_toe.py script using the command python tic_tac_toe.py.
    Click on the desired cell to make your move. The computer will automatically make its move.
    Continue playing until there is a winner or the game ends in a tie.
    Press 'RSHIFT' to restart the game at any time.

# Code Structure

    tic_tac_toe.py: The main script that contains the game logic and user interface.
    The game uses Pygame for window creation, event handling, and drawing.

# Customization

Feel free to customize the game by adjusting the constants such as colors, grid size, and line width in the script. You can also modify the intelligent move generator to make the computer's strategy more challenging.
